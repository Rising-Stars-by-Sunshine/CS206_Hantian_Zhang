## About Me
I am Hantian Zhang from Jiangsu Province, China. Now Iâ€™m a junior student majoring in Math with CS track. I am deeply interested in economics, and I enjoy learning relative knowledge. I am dedicated to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in game theory. 

## Introduction of Computational Microeconomics Problem Set 1

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Problem Set 1 of COMSCI/ECON206 Computational Microeconomics, instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at DKU. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of game theory and equips them with the computational tools necessary to analyze and model complex economic systems. In this repository, you will find explanations for the questions regarding game theory assigned in the milestone 1 and 2. By exploring the intersection of computer science and economics, you are expected to develop a deeper understanding of how computational techniques can be applied to address real-world economic challenges.
